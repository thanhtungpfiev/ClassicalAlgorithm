Given a stack how to reverse the elements of the stack without using any other
data-structure. You cannot use another stack too.
Hint: Use recursion (system stack.) When you go inside the stack pop elements
from stack in each subsequent call until stack is empty. Then push these
elements one by one when coming out of the recursion. The elements will be
reversed.
