Hint: Keep two stack one will be general stack, which will just keep the
elements. The second will keep the min value.
1. Push: Push an element to the top of stack1. Compare the new value with
the value at the top of the stack2. If the new value is smaller, then push the
new value into stack2. Or push the value at the top of the stack2 to itself
once more.
2. Pop: Pop an element from top of stack1 and return. Pop an element from
top of stack2 too.
3. Min: Read from the top of the stack2 this value will be the min.
