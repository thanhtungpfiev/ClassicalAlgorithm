BruteForce Approach

Just we need to compare both string by traversing
if t[i] == s[i] , we will increase the count.
if cnt == s.length() this means t is the subsequence of s
As, it contains alll the characters.

MEMOIZATION TECHNIQUE

Here the idea is to check whether the size of the longest common subsequence is equal to the size of str1.
If itâ€™s equal it means there is a subsequence that exists in str2.
