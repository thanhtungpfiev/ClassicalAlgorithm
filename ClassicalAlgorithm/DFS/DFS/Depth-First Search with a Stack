In a depth-first search, we traverse down a path until we get a dead end; then
we backtrack by popping a stack to get an alternative path.
路 Create a stack
路 Create a start point
路 Push the start point onto the stack
路 While (value searching not found and the stack is not empty)
o Pop the stack
o Find all possible points after the one which we just tried
o Push these points onto the stack
