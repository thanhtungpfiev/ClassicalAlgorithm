In a naive approach, we would have to consider each cell and find if it is reachable to both the oceans by checking if it is able to reach - 1. top or left edge(atlantic) and, 2. bottom or right edge (pacific). This would take about O((mn)^2), which is not efficient.

Now, if we start from the cells connected to altantic ocean and visit all cells having height greater than current cell (water can only flow from a cell to another one with height equal or lower), we are able to reach some subset of cells (let's call them A).

Next, we start from the cells connected to pacific ocean and repeat the same process, we find another subset (let's call this one B).

The final answer we get will be the intersection of sets A and B (A âˆ© B).
