The key observation is that the quotient of a division is just the number of times that we can subtract the divisor from the dividend without making it negative.

Suppose dividend = 15 and divisor = 3, 15 - 3 > 0. We now try to subtract more by shifting 3 to the left by 1 bit (6). Since 15 - 6 > 0, shift 6 again to 12.
Now 15 - 12 > 0, shift 12 again to 24, which is larger than 15. So we can at most subtract 12 from 15. Since 12 is obtained by shifting 3 to left twice,
it is 1 << 2 = 4 times of 3. We add 4 to an answer variable (initialized to be 0). The above process is like 15 = 3 * 4 + 3. We now get part of the
quotient (4), with a remaining dividend 3.

Then we repeat the above process by subtracting divisor = 3 from the remaining dividend = 3 and obtain 0. We are done. In this case, no shift happens.
We simply add 1 << 0 = 1 to the answer variable.
